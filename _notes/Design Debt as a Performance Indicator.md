[[Design debt]] is not maintained for documentation. Meeting standards is a basic quality expected in product building. Not following the standards will break standards while [[Implementing a design System]] practices and principles. This is especially critical while building consumer-facing products, as [[Software design should be opinionated]].

To reduce Design Debt, it should be considered as a performance indicator. If it is solved, and when it is solved (Open UX Debt Age) should be considered an indicator of the product team's performance evaluation.
