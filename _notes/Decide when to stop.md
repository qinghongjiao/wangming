Stop aiming for an ideal, perfect design. We'll never get there. Instead of keeping 'perfect design' as the benchmark, compare with the **baseline** — the current reality and how much this change enhanced their experience. 

Comparing with baseline and knowing that it's improving the product _for users_ will motivate the product team. It’s less about us and more about value for the customer. Scope grows naturally, like grass. It's not the fault of managers, programmers, or clients. More, we reach more profound; we see more micro details and potentials — not only blockers, but also potential improvements. 

Making choices makes the product better, as long as it follows a direction. [[Software design should be opinionated]]. Always see features as must-haves and nice-to-haves, and [[Prioritize enablers and blockers]]
